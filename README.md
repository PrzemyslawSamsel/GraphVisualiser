## Goal 
The goal of this project is to develop universal tool for generating signal graphstructures.

## Plot parameters

The tool provides user with few parameters that can be manipulated in order to change the look of the structure or to make it more readable. This parameters are:
* Column offset - changes the column offset
* Vertical offset - changes the vertical offset
* Bridge size - changes the size of the bridge, that is the short line between the in/out data and the operation.
* Lables and fonts
  * x - changes the literal of the vector with input data
  * y - changes the literal of the vector with output data
  * sum - changes the literal of the operations presented in circles
  * font size - changes the font size
* Stretch columns - streaches the columns so that the input and output data is positioned in the middle 
* Show grid - shows grid for easier manipulation

## Loading from files

Matrices can be loaded from files separately, filled manually, or filled from files automatically based on their names (must match!):
